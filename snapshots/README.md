# GloRo Snapshots

This directory contains snapshots of the original code used to produce the various papers related to this repository. All code is provided "as-is;" by contrast, the code in the main repository is better maintained and more developer friendly. It is therefore recommended that this code be used only for precise reproducibility purposes, while the main repository is the preferred source when possible.
